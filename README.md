# TuneIn

Our group members are Matthew Lieber, Lang Xu, Cam Savage, David Guo, Nick Lyu and Yunqing Ma. For our project we want to make a website that will be the front end of a recommendation service using the natural language classifier and the Spotify API to recommend the user songs and artist depending on what they ask for.
